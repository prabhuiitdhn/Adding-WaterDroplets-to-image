# WaterDroplets
Generating water droplets in real-time images using Computer Vision. 
using the computer vision technique, We are trying to generate water droplets in the real-time images. To train the model for generating a large number of water droplets images, aur rainy seasoned images, we need to have have dataset but generating datasets for the water droplets is bit difficult and unable to get real-time dataset. So, we are trying to use image processing concepts which produces the texture of water droplets and later integrate with real-times images which helps to generate a large amount of images for traing Deep learning model for rainy season, or initial stage of rainy season conditioned.

Please look inside the folder which includes input, and output image which produces droplets images.
